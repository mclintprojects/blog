For when I’m asked, “Do you have any questions for us?”

## Getting to know the interviewer

- Why do you work here? (Do they have any intrinsic motivations?)
- What does a day in your life at this job look like?
- What’s the biggest struggle you’ve had here? Why?
- What’s your favourite thing to have shipped? Why?
- Where do you see yourself at this company in the next 2 years? (Interesting way to know tenure of employees. Also a gander at lateral mobility & growth within the company)

## Company dynamics

- What is the software development process here like? (testing, pair-programming, contributing, bug tracking, version control)
- What management style does my immediate manager have?
- What is the performance review process like?

## Setting myself up for success

- What are some things you’ve seen new teammates struggle with?
- Were I to join, what advice would you give me to ensure my success on the team?
