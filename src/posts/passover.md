ðŸ’¡ This is not investment advice. Iâ€™m only writing about how I personally invest. You can modify it to fit your own investment goals.
</aside>

Here's the modest investment strategy that has me unbothered about the bloodbath in the markets right now:

1. Most of my income is in stablecoins, and I only invest a small part.
    - My ratio is **70%** stablecoin/USD savings and **30%** investments.
    - I hold **very little** local currency (GHS, NGN etc.) for day-to-day upkeep.
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ”‘ Keeping a large chunk of your wealth in an ever-weakening currency means you're performing a wealth transfer to thieving politicians. Funny enough, they don't make the same mistake because they immediately siphon their proceeds to stronger currencies offshore.
    
    </aside>
    
2. Weekly DCA of **only** blue-chip assets (e.g. BTC, ETH, MATIC, VOO, SPY, AAPL, MSFT, META, GOOG).
    - Trying to get rich quickly with brittle assets will, more often than not, burn you.
3. Thinking long-term (4-10 yrs) wrt investing and the returns therein.
    - Close your mind to day-to-day price swings. Don't act on them.
    - Pay attention only to fundamentals. If nothing about the fundamentals changes for the worse, keep dollar-cost-averaging.
    - If you're investing in an asset with solid fundamentals over a long period, the only way to go is up.
